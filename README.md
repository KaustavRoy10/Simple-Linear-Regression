## Introduction

This is a repo demonstrating Simple Linear Regression. 

We use two models that is : 
- statsmodels
- sklearn

## Contents 

This repo contains a ipynb file with the code demonstrating Simple Linear Regression and 'advertsing.csv' which is our dataset

## Conclusion 

After running Linear regressing using both the models, we see that the results are identical.
